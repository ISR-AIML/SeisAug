**SeismoAugment:** _A comprehensive Data Augmentation Python Toolkit  as a gateway to Deep Learning_
The present toolkit is developed to address the significant challenge of limited Region and depth specific labeled data  in seismological studies, a preliminary drawback in the application of deep learning and machine learning. 
Data augmentation has emerged as a simple but effective solution to this problem to enhance model performance. 

**Installation Via pip**
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Installation Via Conda**
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
